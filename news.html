                        <p>Harry Brook is undeniably one of the rising stars in English cricket. This summer, he showcased his potential by scoring a half-century at Lord's and a century at Trent Bridge against the West Indies. Despite his achievements, the 25-year-old remains humble, dismissing comparisons with former greats and focusing on carving out his own unique path in the sport.</p>

                        <h3>Ireland, Zimbabwe gear up for historic Test in Belfast</h3>
                        <p>It's not often that Ireland and Zimbabwe get to play Test cricket, and this will be the first ever red-ball encounter between the two sides as Ireland gears up to host Zimbabwe for the one-off Test match in Belfast, starting on Thursday (July 25). Rust is inevitable for the tourists who haven't featured in the longest format since February 2023. They are also grappling with a squad that is short on experience with a plethora of young talent who've only recently made it to the Test squad.</p>

                        <p>When the blue and yellow face off, there is a lot of fanfare irrespective of the tournament and this showdown was no different. It was the Texas Super Kings who cantered home and won by nine wickets to knock holders MI New York out of MLC 2024. Marcus Stoinis (2 for 18) was instrumental with ball in hand while Faf du Plessis (72 off 47) and Devon Conway (51 off 43) led the chase with a 101-run stand in the chase.</p>
